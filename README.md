# AthleteInForm (OLD // BEING REBUILT)
## This App is being rebuilt using MERN stack, allowing migration from Firestore to MongoDB for a more organized, stable, productive, and simplistic design.

Progressive Web Application in development intended to be a recovery log which athletes will submit post-training to help athletic trainers manage their athletes' health, stay organized by keeping everything in one place (the app), and schedule treatments as necessary.
